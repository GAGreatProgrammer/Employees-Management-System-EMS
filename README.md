# **Employees Management System (EMS)**

#### EMS is an effective personnel management tool that allows you to easily and quickly administer all types of workplaces. The system includes, on the one hand, elements of registration of employees and their subsequent management, and on the other hand, the possibility of obtaining comprehensive information about current employees. The commercial success of the company and the prospects for its further growth directly depend on the successful and efficient operation of this system.

<br/>

#### EMS capabilities, like its goals, are not limited to employee management. The purpose of the system is to make the information of any employee available not only from a personal computer or other device, but also from anywhere in the world to receive / process complete information of the personnel. Such requests can be implemented using a special bot that gives any employee with the appropriate access level access to information about employees. The bot is based on Telegram Bot and can establish direct access to the employee management system database.
